![Electron + Vite + Tailwind Starter](screenshot.png)

This Starter utilizes [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) in combination. It tries to adhere the best practices mentioned in the [Talk by Kilian Valkhof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw4PmPaghyU)

Also does it use [Tailwinds JIT Mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode).
